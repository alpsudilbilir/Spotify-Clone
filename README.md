# Spotify Clone ðŸŽ§
Spotify clone is an iOS app which uses [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) to show and play, albums, artists, songs and playlists.
API allows to play 30 second preview of the songs(and not every song). So there might be some bugs. I work on this project to learn more about iOS development with UIKit and consodilate my knowledge.
